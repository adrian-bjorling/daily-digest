# Daily digest
Small script to get a daily update of my schedule. Scraped from a large company planner made in excel.

## Reason
The excel document is very hard to read. Especially when I'm using a phone to look at it on the go.
So with this script i can get a daily mail sent to me with what I'm doing today and a number of days ahed. And with whom I'll be working with.
